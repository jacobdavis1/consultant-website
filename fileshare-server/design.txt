This api is responsible for uploading files to an Azure FileShare. Once finished, it will implement three main features:
1. Uploading files to and retrieving files from an Azure FileShare
2. Protecting file access with authentication via JWTs
3. File structure based on user information and designed for ease of navigation on the FileShare side

Notes about each feature goal below.

Goal 1 Notes 

Goal 2 Notes 
- Considering Auth0 for this job still. Okta a possibility.

Goal 3 Notes 
- Users should have first and last name, as well as a UUID attached to their JWT. This will enable the files to be organized by name, which is preferable for people navigating the files manually.
